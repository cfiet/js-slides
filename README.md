js-slides
=========

Some JavaScript presentations I did

### Dependencies
Slides are created with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) so to view them, you only need HTML5-capable browser.

If you want to see the [speaker nodes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#speaker-notes),
you will need a webserver. Repo comes with configured [express]() app that you can use if
you have [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Running
Just open ``content/<presentation>/index.html``.

If you want to run it from Node, ``cd`` the presentation directory and run ``npm install .``.
Then open ``http://localhost:10111``... but you probably already know that, don't ya?
